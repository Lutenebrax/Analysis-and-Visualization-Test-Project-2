# Test Project 5

For this project we will use a dataset containing the Euro daily exchange rate between 1999 and 2021.
This is a quick project in which we will use a different way to create graphic data visualization related to the Euro-dollar exchange rate during some non-covid 19 pandemic years and the covid pandemic years.
